## The Idea

I, [@TechCrafterGaming](https://github.com/TechCrafterGaming), had the program or rather a program that ran from several parts of code. \
This "program" had a simple purpose and that was that you could have the possibility to control a variety of functions via a second keyboard.
You should not be limited to the simple keys but you should be able to create a kind of profiles to create an infinite number of keys or hotkeys.
The original "program" consisted of a mix from ```lua```, ```autoit```, ```batch``` and ```autohotkey (AHK)```.

And now the idea was to make a better Programm out of the shit that already was there.
This time with a nice looking GUI that is capable to run on other Devices as the host PC.
